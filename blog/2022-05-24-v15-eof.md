Watchmen V15 series, which deployed about 2 months ago, and was the very first version we published, working with us over 1 year, we decide
stop to maintain, and will not fix bug in this version again.

We already notify all our friends to upgrade their images to V16.1.x, and get good feedback from them. So if you still on V15 series, we
highly recommend to upgrade to V16.1 immediately.

We offer upgrade scripts, you can find it
at [watchmen-migration](https://github.com/Indexical-Metrics-Measure-Advisory/watchmen/tree/main/packages/watchmen-migration/v15.x-to-v16/meta-scripts)
, just enjoy it.
