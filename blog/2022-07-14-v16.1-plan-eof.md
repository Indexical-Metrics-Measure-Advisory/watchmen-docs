Watchmen V16.1 series, is planning to stop to maintain in few weeks after 16.3 deployed.

We have done refactoring in 16.2, which leads the package structure break changes. In detail, we extract the common part from 4 supported
rds storage (MySQL/MSSQL/Oracle/PostgreSQL) to a new package `watchment-storage-rds`. This change reduce our maintain cost on rds part, but
on the other hand, because of lacking of manpower resource, it's really hard to maintain 16.1 since it still in original structure. Anyway,
V16.1 is still on maintain now, but it's better to do upgrading to V16.2 now.

One more thing about V16.3, after we deploy the indicator workbench in V16.2, there is one more exciting feature will be deployed in 16.3,
which is `Synonym Topic`. It introduces direct link to rds, to reuse the existing tables and views, to maximize the existing data usages. We
are still on the final round verification work now, will be released in few weeks ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.
