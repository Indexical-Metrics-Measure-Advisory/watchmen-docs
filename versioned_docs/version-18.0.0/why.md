## Why build a fit-for-purpose data architecture instead of adopting a mainstream stack

### Industry focus
- Big data engines: Apache Spark, Apache Flink
- Ecosystem: Modern Data Stack — https://www.moderndatastack.xyz/
- Common belief: these are the “standard solutions” for data processing

### Hidden complexity of toolchains
- Each stage demands a specialized tool and configuration
- Typical components:
  - Batch processing systems
  - Stream processing engines
  - Data governance platforms
  - Data modeling tools
  - Configuration management systems
  - Application layer for data products
- Result: an extremely complex technical architecture that is costly to operate

### Pain heard from business teams
- “We have every tool but still cannot deliver analysis.”
- Significant effort is spent maintaining and integrating open‑source and commercial tools, not producing insights

### What organizations really need
- A platform that lets business users focus on business, not tool configuration
- A platform that enables efficient cross‑role collaboration, not blocked by toolchain complexity
- A platform that makes data easy to use across the team, not constrained by individual tool limits

### Watchmen approach
- Unified platform that integrates ingestion, modeling, orchestration, governance, and analysis
- Role‑based workspaces for clarity and collaboration: Admin, Console, DQC, Indicator
- Visual orchestration and monitoring to shorten time‑to‑value

### No‑code development lowers cognitive load
- Configure ingestion, modeling, pipelines, and analytics via GUI
- Reduce onboarding time for business and data roles
- Standardize patterns to avoid bespoke scripts and one‑off tooling

### Serverless operations lower management cost
- Deploy components with serverless options to reduce ops overhead
- Scale automatically and pay per use; minimize idle resource costs
- Centralized configuration and observability replacing per‑service maintenance

:::tip Key takeaways
- Reduce integration overhead and operational complexity
- Improve collaboration and delivery speed across data roles
- Build a fit‑for‑purpose architecture aligned with business outcomes
- Lower cognitive load with no‑code workflows
- Lower management cost with serverless operations
